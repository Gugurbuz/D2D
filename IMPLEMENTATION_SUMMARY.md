## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### Schema Overview

**New Tables Created:**

1. **contract_drafts** (28 columns)
   - Stores all contract state for auto-save
   - Tracks completion percentage and stage
   - Records device and session information
   - Auto-expires after 7 days

2. **contract_audit_log** (15 columns)
   - Immutable audit trail
   - Tracks every action with timestamp
   - Records IP address and geolocation
   - Essential for legal compliance

3. **offline_sync_queue** (14 columns)
   - Manages pending operations
   - Tracks retry attempts
   - Stores error details
   - Priority-based processing

4. **contract_signatures** (12 columns)

### Security (Row Level Security)

All tables implement RLS policies:

- Audit logs are append-only (no deletion)
- Automatic ownership verification

### Performance Optimizations

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_contract_drafts_visit` - Fast lookup by visit
